- Use print/console.log debugging
- Use IDE tools (VS Code Debugger, breakpoints)
- Binary search in code (narrow down)
- Rubber duck debugging
- Unit testing

### 🧩 Debugging Practice:
- Solve buggy problems: [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/), [Exercism](https://exercism.io/)
- Create intentional bugs in your code and fix them

### 🧪 Tools:
- Chrome DevTools
- VS Code Debugger
- Node.js Debugging
- Python `pdb` / JavaScript `debugger` keyword

---

## 📍 Phase 5: Competitive Programming & Deep Dive (Ongoing)

### 🎯 Goal:
Tackle complex problems under constraints and improve speed.

### 🧩 Platforms:
- [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/)
- [AtCoder](https://atcoder.jp/)
- [LeetCode Weekly Contest](https://leetcode.com/contest/)

### 🧠 Learn:
